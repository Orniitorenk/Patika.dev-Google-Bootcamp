Planetary system enhanced with Cinemachine

I used the Cinemachine tool to orbit the planets around the sun. I made the planets rotate around themselves with a simple script. I used the gizmos to show the orbits of the planets. I have worked with lifelike numeric values and found it visually disturbing. I tried to get realistic results by finding optimized numbers.
